## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- In this challenge, I learned how to wrap HTML tags that allow me to manipulate small sized SVG images with CSS code to create their float, position, and background.

- In this challenge, I used the BEM class writing method for the second time and I think I learned the class writing method better with this method.

You can learn the basic method of writing classes in CSS from their website.
[BEM website](https://en.bem.info/)


### Continued development
After fully learning CSS, I will go to js.
